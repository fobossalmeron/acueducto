Fueled by the idea that young artists can make an innovative impact in the film industry, she worked along with film production house Bala Films to create La Danza de las Fieras (The Wild Dance).<br/><br/>La Danza de las Fieras is a feature-length film that raises awareness on human trafficking. It’s made up of six short films, each one focused on a different dimension of this topic.

That way the whole narrative around the project was controlled; not just on the web app, but also in the press.<br/><br/>It is common throughout press articles to find that the messages and adjectives of La Danza de las Fieras’ web app were used, most of them word by word.",

In film festival’s box office listings, they can compete with hundreds of other films for viewers’ attention. Most of them do not have a proper portal to hold their synopsis, credits, and trailer, and this lack of preview assets impacts the film’s viewing rate. This is why SEO for “La Danza de las Fieras” was paramount. A lot of effort was used on this so that any search of that combination of words would show the web app as the first result."
