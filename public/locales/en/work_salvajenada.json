Their taste for rousing new styles has spotted breaking artists such as Tyler The Creator, Anderson .Paak, Mac DeMarco, Alt-J, Parcels, and many more before they turned into indie stars. Their desire to share music has taken them from blogging to arranging local gigs; from sharing news to partnering with music festivals; they’ve done interviews, articles, and many more activities to keep their channels fueled.</br></br>But one year before we partnered, despite their best efforts, Salvajenada was showing signs of decay. Their social media channels were deserted, their website was outdated and slow, and all its collaborators felt like the project had already given everything it had; nobody was taking any action.",
